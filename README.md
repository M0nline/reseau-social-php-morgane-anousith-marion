## Built With

* [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/) - Local web development solution
* [PHP 8](https://www.php.net/) - Scripting language
* [mySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - Relational database management system (RDBMS)

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - IDE

## Collaboration

### Method

In the initial phase of exploring the provided codebase, we worked independently to gain a thorough understanding of the code and the mandated technology stack. 

Once we were comfortable with the code and the technologies involved, we distributed the tasks among ourselves.

For tackling complex problems, especially those related to authentication challenges, we employed mob programming. 

This approach allowed us to collaboratively navigate through intricate issues by harnessing the collective expertise and perspectives of the entire team.

### Tools

We utilized the following collaboration tools:

- Notion (Kanban)
- VSC LiveShare (VSC extension)
- Git, GitHub
